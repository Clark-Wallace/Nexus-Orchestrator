# Vision Contract

The human's input to the AI Architect. Deliberately sparse.
This is a creative brief, not a technical spec. The Architect's job is to expand this into a full Architecture Template.

You do not need to fill every field. The Architect will ask clarifying questions for anything critical that's missing.

## Identity

**Project Name:** ___

**Domain:** ___
*(e.g., data center ops, emergency management, airline operations, power grid, logistics, facility management)*

**One-Sentence Purpose:** ___
*(What does this sim exist to do? "Train NOC operators to handle cascading failures" or "Let players run a city through a hurricane season")*

---

## Primary Questions

What should someone learn or discover by using this sim?

1. ___
2. ___
3. ___

---

## Feel

**Reference Experience:** ___
*(e.g., "Oregon Trail but for uptime," "air traffic control meets triage," "SimCity but the systems actually depend on each other")*

**Core Tension:** ___
*(What is the player/operator constantly balancing? e.g., "cooling vs. compute load vs. power budget," "speed vs. safety vs. cost")*

**Pacing:** [ ] Real-time pressure / [ ] Deliberate strategic turns / [ ] Mixed (calm periods with crisis spikes)

---

## Scope

**What's inside the sim:**
- ___
- ___
- ___

**What's outside (external inputs or abstracted away):**
- ___
- ___

**What is explicitly NOT modeled (non-goals):**
- ___
- ___

---

## Key Systems (if you have opinions — otherwise let the Architect propose)

- ___
- ___
- ___
- ___

---

## Non-Negotiables

Hard constraints the Architect cannot override. Leave blank if defaults from the constitution apply.

- [ ] Information imperfection modeled (default: yes)
- [ ] Full action catalog compliance (default: yes)
- Other: ___

---

## Target Fidelity

How deep should this go?

- [ ] Tier 3 — Structure + Flows + Constraints (playable proof of concept)
- [ ] Tier 5 — Through Dependencies/Cascades (full operational sim)
- [ ] Tier 7 — Full stack including AI intelligence layer

---

## Time Model

**Tick size preference:** ___  *(or "Architect decides")*

**Run horizon:** ___  *(e.g., "a 30-day hurricane season," "a 12-hour shift," "open-ended")*

---

## Audience

**Who uses this sim?**
- [ ] Training / education
- [ ] Players (game context)
- [ ] Planners / analysts
- [ ] Developers (testing / experimentation)

**Assumed expertise level:** [ ] Novice / [ ] Practitioner / [ ] Expert

---

## Output Preferences

**What should the user see?**
- [ ] Dashboard with KPIs
- [ ] Event timeline
- [ ] Decision cards (organic UX)
- [ ] After-action review / replay
- Other: ___

---

## Technology Constraints (if any)

**Platform:** ___  *(e.g., "web browser," "Python CLI," "React app," "don't care")*

**Language preference:** ___  *(or "Architect decides")*

**Must integrate with:** ___  *(or "standalone")*

---

## Inspirations and References (optional)

Anything the Architect should look at for domain grounding:
- ___
- ___
- ___

---

## Approval Gates

What do you want to review before building proceeds?

- [ ] System decomposition (before any code)
- [ ] State schemas (before implementation)
- [ ] First playable tick (before expanding scope)
- [ ] Subsystem one-pagers (as each is designed)
- [ ] All of the above (recommended)

---

## Notes

Anything else the Architect should know:

___

---

*This contract is input to the AI Architect. The Architect expands it into a full Architecture Template (Doc 02) and presents it for human approval before any building begins.*
